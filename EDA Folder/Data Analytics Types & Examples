Data Analytics Types & Examples
1️⃣ Descriptive Analytics (What Happened?)
📌 Definition: Descriptive analytics summarizes past data to identify patterns and trends. It answers "What happened?" but does not explain why it happened.

🔹 Example Use Cases:
✔ Sales Performance – Monthly sales reports showing revenue trends.
✔ Website Traffic Analysis – Tracking visitor counts over time using Google Analytics.
✔ Customer Behavior – Measuring product return rates and customer satisfaction scores.

🔹 Methods Used:
📊 Data Aggregation – Summarizing raw data into reports.
📈 Data Visualization – Using charts, graphs, and dashboards.
📉 Statistical Measures – Mean, median, mode, percentages.

🔹 Example:
Total Sales in Q1 = $50,000
Customer Satisfaction Score = 85%
Website Bounce Rate = 40%
✅ Key Takeaway: Helps in understanding past trends, but does not explain the causes.

2️⃣ Diagnostic Analytics (Why Did It Happen?)
📌 Definition: Diagnostic analytics identifies the reasons behind trends and helps answer "Why did it happen?"

🔹 Example Use Cases:
✔ Customer Churn Analysis – Finding reasons why customers are leaving.
✔ Sales Decline Investigation – Identifying why revenue dropped in Q3.
✔ Website Traffic Drop – Diagnosing reasons for a sudden dip in visitors.

🔹 Methods Used:
🔍 Drill-Down Analysis – Breaking down data into smaller parts.
📊 Correlation Analysis – Finding relationships between variables.
📉 Root Cause Analysis (RCA) – Pinpointing the main cause of a problem.

🔹 Example:
Sales in Q3 dropped by 20% → Diagnosed as marketing budget cuts & product delays.
Website Traffic Fell by 30% → Diagnosed as SEO ranking drop due to a Google algorithm update.
✅ Key Takeaway: Explains "why" an event happened using detailed analysis and correlation techniques.

3️⃣ Predictive Analytics (What Will Happen?)
📌 Definition: Predictive analytics uses historical data, machine learning, and statistics to forecast future trends. It helps businesses make proactive decisions based on predictions.

🔹 Example Use Cases:
✔ Sales Forecasting – Predicting next quarter’s revenue based on trends.
✔ Customer Churn Prediction – Identifying customers who are likely to leave.
✔ Fraud Detection – Predicting fraudulent transactions in banking.

🔹 Methods Used:
🤖 Machine Learning Models – Regression, classification, time-series forecasting.
📈 Trend Analysis – Identifying seasonal and long-term patterns.
🔮 Probability Scoring – Calculating the likelihood of future events.

🔹 Example:
Customer Churn Prediction Model → Identifies high-risk customers and triggers retention offers.
Sales Prediction Model → Forecasts 10% revenue growth next quarter.
Loan Default Risk → Predicts which loan applicants may default based on credit history.
✅ Key Takeaway: Predicts future trends using data-driven algorithms and models.
