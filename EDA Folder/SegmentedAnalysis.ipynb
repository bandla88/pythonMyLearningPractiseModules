    "Segmented Analysis in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Segmented analysis in EDA involves breaking down the dataset into different groups based on categorical or numerical variables to uncover insights that may not be visible in the overall dataset. This helps in identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies within subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Perform Segmented Analysis?\n",
    "To understand variations across different groups.\n",
    "To detect patterns that may be hidden in the overall data.\n",
    "To identify anomalies specific to a segment.\n",
    "To compare performance across different categories.\n",
    "Common Methods for Segmented Analysis\n",
    "Segmenting by Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Analyzing customer spending behavior based on gender, region, or product category.\n",
    "Visualization: Bar charts, boxplots, or count plots.\n",
    "Segmenting by Numerical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Dividing data into age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-50) to analyze salary distributions.\n",
    "Visualization: Histograms, violin plots, or density plots.\n",
    "Segmenting by Time-Based Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Analyzing sales performance before and after a marketing campaign.\n",
    "Visualization: Line charts, time series plots.\n",
    "Segmenting by Business Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Grouping customers based on revenue contribution (High, Medium, Low) to study their purchasing behavior.\n",
    "Example: Segmented Analysis on Customer Purchases\n",
    "Dataset:\n",

    "Analysis:\n",
    "Segment by Gender â†’ Find if males or females spend more on average.\n",
    "Segment by Age Group â†’ Create bins (18-25, 26-35, etc.) and check spending patterns.\n",
    "Segment by Region â†’ Compare average purchases across different regions.\n",

    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "Segmented analysis uncovers hidden insights by breaking data into meaningful subgroups.\n",
    "It improves decision-making by identifying group-specific trends.\n",
    "Visualizations like bar plots, box plots, and histograms make it easier to interpret segmented data."
